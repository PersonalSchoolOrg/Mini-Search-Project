Men armed with guns and machetes attacked residents of a Kenyan village before dawn Tuesday killing at least five people witnesses told CNN
The attackers went house to house targeting residents in the village of Kasakakairu the witnesses said
Six people have been admitted to a local hospital with serious injuries and police are checking the area for more victims
Kasakakairu is approximately 34 kilometers 21 miles from Mpeketoni a southeastern Kenyan coastal town where a terrorist attack killed dozens of people earlier this month Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said last week that AlShabaab the al Qaedalinked militant group active in Somalia wasn't responsible for the Mpeketoni attack
Instead he blamed local political networks for the attack that witnesses said turned a World Cup viewing party into a bloodbath
Armed men stormed the city center shooting and hacking people to death before moving into a residential area where they went from door to door the witnesses said

A trio of earthquakes struck in the South Pacific Ocean Tuesday morning southeast of Raoul Island New Zealand the US Geological Survey said
There were no immediate reports of damage
Two quakes with magnitudes of 69 and 63 hit within minutes of each other according to USGS data The larger of the two was originally reported by the USGS to be a 72 magnitude but that measure was later downgraded to 69
A third 62magnitude quake struck about 45 minutes later
The quakes hit near the eastern edge of the Australian tectonic plate one of the most active seismic regions in the world according to the USGS
The quakes all a depth of about 12 miles and happened about 50 miles southeast of Raoul Island
The deadly Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has hit unprecedented proportions according to relief workers on the ground
The epidemic is out of control Dr Bart Janssens director of operations for Doctors Without Borders said in a statement
There have been 567 cases and 350 deaths since the epidemic began in March according to the latest World Health Organization figures
In April CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta traveled to Conakry Guinea to report on what was being done to treat patients and contain the outbreak
It took only moments to feel the impact of what was happening here Gupta wrote after landing in Conakry There is a lot we know about Ebola and it scares us almost as much as what we don't know
Ebola outbreaks usually are confined to remote areas making it easier to contain But this outbreak is different patients have been identified in 60 locations in Guinea Sierra Leone and Liberia
Officials believe the wide footprint of this outbreak is partly because of the close proximity between the jungle where the virus was first identified and cities such as Conakry The capital in Guinea has a population of 2 million and an international airport
People are traveling without realizing they're carrying the deadly virus It can take between two and 21 days after exposure for someone to feel sick Ebola is a violent killer The symptoms at first mimic the flu headache fever fatigue What comes next sounds like something out of a horror movie significant diarrhea and vomiting while the virus shuts off the blood ability to clot As a result patients often suffer internal and external hemorrhaging Many die in an average of 10 days
There are at least five different strains of Ebola and in past outbreaks this virus  the Zaire strain  has killed as many as nine out of 10 people it infects Gutpa wrote  Men and women young and old Ebola does not discriminate
Doctors Without Borders also known as Médecins Sans Frontières is the only aid organization treating people affected by the virus Since March they have sent more than 300 staff members and 40 tons of equipment and supplies to the region to help fight the epidemic
Still they warn it not enough
Despite the human resources and equipment deployed by MSF in the three affected countries we are no longer able to send teams to the new outbreak sites
The good news is that Ebola isn't as easily spread as one may think A patient isn't contagious  meaning they can't spread the virus to other people  until they are already showing symptoms
Health officials have urged residents to alert MSF or local physicians at the first sign of flulike symptoms While there is no cure or vaccine to treat Ebola MSF has proved it doesn't have to be a death sentence if it treated early
Inside isolation treatment areas doctors focus on keeping the patients hydrated with IV drips and other liquid nutrients
Gupta describes the scene at an isolation ward in Guinea
Going into the isolation ward Gupta says meant stopping in a separate tent beforehand to gear up
Healthcare workers dressed in scrubs and thick white rubber boots They slipped on blue latex gloves then a thick yellow impermeable suit followed by a mask then a white hood with another mask built into it A pair of large clear goggles went over the hood and then a large white apron
Not a single part of his skin was exposed Gupta remembers
It has to be this way for these doctors and nurses who knowingly expose themselves to Ebola  but you have to wonder what goes through the minds of the patients seeing these rubberclad aliens looming in front of them
Early treatment seems to be helping save lives During this outbreak instead of the typical 10% survival rate about 40% of patients have pulled through
MSF says they'll continue to isolate and treat Ebola patients in West Africa with the resources they have available but they urge a massive deployment by regional governments and aid agencies to help stop the epidemic
World Health Organization officials say they're planning highlevel meetings for the Minister of Health in the subregion July 23 to discuss the deployment of additional resources and experts to the area
The outbreak will be considered contained after 42 days  twice the incubation period  with no new Ebola cases
A year is a very long time on Mars  687 days NASA Curiosity rover can attest that it enough time for some unexpected life changes
On Tuesday the rover celebrates the oneyear anniversary of its touchdown on the red planet on August 6 2012
Looking back some things have gone much better than anticipated in spite of one nasty snag
Its main mission Find out if Mars could have once hosted life  small stuff like bacteria viruses and fungus A key ingredient for this would be signs that there was once water on the bonedry red planet
Bam Mission accomplished right off the bat
It was supposed to take longer  To find the answer Curiosity was scheduled to take a hike up the slopes of Mars' Mount Sharp a peak nearly as high as Earth Mount McKinley NASA said
But right where the rover landed it stumbled upon an ancient riverbed
Not long after that Curiosity operators back on Earth pulled some dirt from Mar Gale Crater which is the rover exploration areal The samples revealed that water once on Mars had been the right kind to support life
It also found traces of chemicals microbes on Earth use
If Mars had living organisms this would have  been  a  good home for them NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a statement
That success didn't make the challenge of Mt Sharp  which is in the middle of Gale Crater  go away And on the way there Curiosity hit that snag
One of its six wheels broke in late 2013 slowing down the rover already tiptoe pace
Since it landed nearly 700 days ago it has driven slightly less than five miles and its operators are adjusting its itinerary to take it over less rugged terrains
Even with a bum foot like a resolute tourist in a foreign land the rover is snapping lots of pictures By August last year it had sent more than 70000 back to Earth
One of its first was a selfie to show it had made it to Mars
And Curiosity continues to poke around to see what it can find
It has fired its laser tens of thousands of times to help scientists analyze varieties of dirt and stone And it has drilled for more signs of the previous existence of water
Scientists are still assessing the samples in hopes of finding out just how habitable Mars once was eons ago NASA said
In the meantime Curiosity has found another similarity to Earth in its drill bit a mineral called orthoclase It belongs to a class of minerals that makes up more than half of our planet crust and the rover pulled up a rich sample on Mars
The rover drivers have decided to take it easy on Mt Sharp using cameras on NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to map out a path on its lower slopes
But that also making the paths longer
With its two camera eyes and blockshaped head atop a long shaft that looks like a neck Curiosity has a somewhat humanized appearance akin to that of ET
Maybe it a sign of things to come
During its flight to Mars and after its landing it measured radiation levels Scientist are using the measurements to determine how much protection would be required to send human astronauts to Mars
The FBI has rescued 168 children and arrested 281 pimps in a countrywide crackdown on child sex trafficking
The operation which took place over the last week in more than 100 cities involved nearly 400 law enforcement agencies authorities said Monday
The message said FBI Director James  Comey should be clear Our children are not for sale  We will respond and crush these pimps who would crush these children
Since 2008 the FBI and its partners have rescued close to 3600 children The agency said investigations have led to 1450 convictions and the seizure of more than $3 million in assets
These are not faraway kids in faraway lands These are our kids on our street corners our truck stops our motels our casinos These are America children Comey said
Speaking alongside the director Leslie Caldwell assistant attorney general for the Justice Department criminal division stressed scores of more children remain victimized
She urged anyone with information about such abuse to contact authorities
Just one call just one online report could mean all the difference for a child who now can only dream of a normal childhood and a life outside prostitution Caldwell said
Australian authorities say they're not certain when a new search area for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be announced clarifying earlier statements suggesting it would be made public Wednesday
Martin Dolan the commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau or ATSB said Tuesday that the analysis of the relevant data will be completed this week but that before we release we have to talk with the Malaysians who are responsible for the overall investigation
The ATSB the agency leading the underwater search for the plane had said Sunday that the new search area would be announced Wednesday
We are waiting for the Malaysians to get back to us on that Dolan said Tuesday I suspect we will know when within the next 24 hours
More than three months after Flight 370 disappeared over Southeast Asia searchers have found no trace of the Boeing 777 or the 239 people aboard making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history
Dolan said he expects that the new analysis of the data from satellites radar and other sources will shift the search area farther south in the Indian Ocean
But he said the team of experts that has been poring over the available information isn't relying on the Malaysian military primary radar data as a measure of changes in altitude during the passenger jet mysterious flight on March 8
Reports that emerged in the early stages of the investigation had suggested the plane may have made dramatic changes in altitude after it turned sharply off its scheduled path from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia to Beijing
CNN safety analyst David Soucie says information about altitude changes is important because it directly affects the calculation of the new search area If the plane did not rise and fall sharply it changes the amount of time and the distance that the aircraft could have flown he said If the plane did not make sharp changes in altitude it would have flown farther and moved farther south than the original search area
Authorities have not been able to explain why the jet veered dramatically off course
An initial tsunami advisory has been canceled for coastal Alaska One had been issued after a magnitude 79 earthquake struck Monday about 15 miles from Little Sitkin Island Alaska
The quake had a depth of 71 miles according to seismologists
The town of Adak evacuated its 150 residents to a shelter about 600 feet above sea level after the initial tsunami warning City Manager Layton Lockett told CNN
There were no initial reports of quake damage in Adak or on Shemya Island said Ian Dickson website manager for the Alaska Earthquake Information Center
Dickson said there were 17 measurable aftershocks in the two hours after the quake
First estimates put the quake at magnitude 80 The strength was subsequently set by the US Geological Survey at 79 magnitude
Heat There been plenty of it to go around in Arizona these first days of summer  literally and politically  after the air conditioning went out at a dog kennel
Sheriff deputies found 20 dead dogs piled up in a shed on Friday at Green Acres Dog Boarding Facility in Gilbert The public shock over their deaths led a US senator to issue a public apology Monday
As fate would have it Republican Sen Jeff Flake son Austin was minding the kennel when the dogs died
Green Acres is owned and operated by two of Flake relatives Jesse and Maleisa Hughes the Maricopa County Sheriff office said
The couple was out of town leaving Austin Flake to dogsit when a dog apparently chewed through the electric wiring connected to the air conditioning said Sheriff Joe Arpaio
He called it an accident but at the same time cast doubt on the kennel owners' account of how the dogs died It was a tragic accident Hughes told CNN We are heartbroken and we're devastated She doesn't believe anyone could have predicted or stopped what happened
The air conditioning unit kicked out in the middle of the night Hughes said
Austin Flake and his wife slept at the east end of the house while the temperature climbed to seething heights in the kennel on the west end Maleisa Hughes said
The dogs sleep there at night in a large cooled room she said
The two sides of the house have separate air conditioning units so the Flakes couldn't feel the suffocating heat
During the day in Gilbert the mercury has blasted up to over 100 degrees F easily making it hard to find relief perhaps even after temperatures dip back down to under 80 at night
By the time the Flakes discovered the dogs at 530 am the temperature was over 100 degrees Hughes said
The gnawed wire was still sputtering off sparks
It could have burned down our whole house Hughes said My whole house could have burned down and all my children could have died and then it would have been a tragedy
One of the dogs that perished was her own
The Flakes turned a hose and ice on the overheated dogs to try to save them the sheriff office said But failed to call for emergency assistance before the dogs died
Sheriff Arpaio said that his office is investigating and that parts of Hughes' story seems suspicious It seems unreasonable that dogs could be healthy at 1100 pm at night and dead by 530 am the next morning as the owners suggest he said
A veterinarian he conferred with has corroborated his doubts Arpaio said
Deputies arrived to find some of the dogs' owners at Green Acres A couple cried and hugged as deputies used a wheel barrow to cart off dogs' carcasses wrapped in cloth
Pet owners told Arpaio that the Hughes misled them about the number of dogs kept at the kennel
The Hughes have not been arrested or charged CNN affiliate KPNX reported
News of the pets' deaths on his son watch were followed by an apology from Sen Flake
I can't imagine the devastating loss these families are experiencing My heart goes out to the owners who lost their beloved pets he said
This is the second summer in a row that Flake has issued a public apology on behalf of one of his progeny
In June of last year another son Tanner Flake reportedly published racial epithets homophobic slurs and antiSemitic remarks on Twitter and used them as user names in online games
During her morning jog in north Houston Hong Nguyen stumbled across an unusual sight a baby girl partially hidden in the bushes near the side of the road
Strapped into a car seat on the ground the 8monthold child was crying
I called 911 Nguyen said And I stayed there with the baby
The chance encounter Monday in an unpopulated area near an industrial zone may have saved the little girl life
She had been missing for about six hours after a man stole the car she was in from outside a gas station in the early hours Her mother had stopped to buy a soda leaving the car keys in the ignition
Authorities had been frantically searching for the baby identified by CNN affiliate KTRK as Genesis Hailey
The car was recovered a few blocks from the gas station about two hours after it was stolen But there was no sign of the child or her car seat
Police said Genesis appeared to be in good health when she was found apart from being hungry and suffering what appeared to be several ant bites
I did spot a couple of ants on the baby and I was able to get them off said Albert Pizana the officer who responded to the jogger emergency call
But police officials said they couldn't comprehend the decision to leave the baby in such an isolated place
I don't know what kind of an animal would do this to a child said Lt H Lopez of the Houston Police Department homicide division Leaving the child in the middle of nowhere
Police officials also faced questions from reporters about the mother decision to leave her child in the car with the engine on
They said she was in the gas station store for a matter of seconds before she saw the thief jump in the car and start driving away with the door still open
He was in such a rush that he backed the car into the railing of the gas pump before he sped off with his infant passenger in the back
The mother ran out of the store but wasn't quick enough to catch the car
It a good reminder for the public not to leave their vehicles running especially with a baby inside Lopez said
Police are still looking for the suspect a man in his late teens or early 20s
It unclear exactly when the baby was taken from the car and put in the bushes Police said it possible she had been left there since the early hours of Monday
Pizana said Genesis was crying intermittently when he and his partner got to her
They took her inside their car and he swaddled her in his uniform shirt to try to calm her His partner retrieved her pacifier for her
Pizana declined to speculate what could have happened to the baby if the jogger hadn't taken that particular route Monday morning
It makes you want to go home and hug your kids even tighter he said

Sting told the UK publication The Mail on Sunday that he won't be leaving his more than $300 million fortune to his six children
I told them there won't be much money left because we are spending it We have a lot of commitments What comes in we spend and there isn't much left he said I certainly don't want to leave them trust funds that are albatrosses round their necks
Not that they've needed the money They all have a good work ethic he added
They have this work ethic that makes them want to succeed on their own merit People make assumptions that they were born with a silver spoon in their mouth but they have not been given a lot he said
Sting children have done well for themselves particularly daughter Mickey who had a major role in the film Frances Ha
The former Police frontman now 62 was born Gordon Sumner and grew up workingclass in Wallsend near Newcastle in northeast Britain He told The Mail on Sunday that he couldn't wait to leave his hometown
It was a pretty violent wrench I didn't feel I belonged there and the family was pretty dysfunctional in many ways My parents were not happy together he said They loved their kids but it was a toxic environment I needed to escape and I am glad I did
Sting went on to great success first with the Police and then as a solo act For his latest work the musical The Last Ship he returned to his childhood
The irony is that I'm going back to Wallsend from where I had done everything in my power to escape he said
The show which is currently running in Chicago is expected to premiere on Broadway in the fall
Sting said he doesn't feel guilty about his wealth  I use my houses and love having them I am grateful I have made money  but he still tries to keep his feet on the ground
I demand a citizen life  I really do Walking the street going to a bar on my own he said I want to be able to pick up my bags from the airport luggage carousel and walk to the car There are times when I don't want or need attention
When it mattered most the man which this Brazilian team quest may depend on delivered once again
Neymar the face of this World Cup scored his fourth goal in three games to book his country a date with destiny and Chile in Belo Horizonte on Saturday
While Lionel Messi has rescued Argentina Neymar 35th goal in 52 international appearances gives an insight into how crucial his role is likely to be in the next few weeks should Brazil go all the way
His two goals and further strikes from the much maligned Fred and substitute Fernandinho ensured Brazil claimed a 41 win over Cameroon and secured top spot in Group A
Mexico which defeated Croatia 31 took second place and will now face the Netherlands in Fortaleza on Sunday
But the night belonged to Neymar  the man who scored the 100th goal of this tournament in his country 100th match World Cup match
Brazil will need its talisman to provide his magic once again when it meets Chile a team which it knocked out of the tournament four years ago in South Africa
Jorge Sampaoli men will represent a far more difficult proposition than a Cameroon side which briefly threatened to cause embarrassment by drawing level at 11
But Neymar having already netted the opener then took charge by scoring his side second and guiding Brazil home
Cameroon thrashed 40 in its previous game by Croatia and already out of the tournament was hardly supposed to represent the most difficult of challenges
Leading through Neymar 17th minute strike Brazil allowed Cameroon back into the contest as its cumbersome defending was once again exposed
Just minutes after Joel Matip header had been deflected onto the crossbar Cameroon leveled to silence those packed inside the Arena Pernambuco
Allan Nyom escaped down the right and after beating the nonexistent challenge of Dani Alves crossed for Matip to tap home from close range
Suddenly from a carnival of color and celebration a dark cloud hung over Brazil World Cup dream
But any negativity was soon washed away by a rampant yellow swagger which ripped through the very heart of the Cameroon defense
Neymar the chief tormentor was afforded far too much room and after leading the defenders a sambalike dance he unleashed a fine effort which wrongfooted the goalkeeper
Suddenly Brazil was rampant Neymar threatened a third when his powerful effort was tipped away by Charles Itandje while Hulk failed to hit the target after a wonderful flowing move
The interval offered little respite for Cameroon and within five minutes it fell further behind when the previously luckless Fred converted David Luiz cross to net his first goal of the tournament
Fernandinho the Manchester City midfielder added a fourth with six minutes remaining to ensure Brazil finished top on goal difference from Mexico
Maybe we tried to hurry things a bit too much early on when we scored our first goal and let anxiety get to us Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said after the match
We need to show more calm and composure Fortunately we ironed out some flaws at halftime and after the break we used the ball better again
El Tri had threatened to usurp the host nation at the top of the table after putting Croatia to the sword in Recife
After a goalless first half Rafael Marquez the first man to captain his country at four World Cups headed Mexico in front with 18 minutes remaining
Andres Guardado rounded off a slick counter attack soon after to double his side advantage before Manchester United star Javier Hernandez added a third
It was a just reward for Mexico which hit the crossbar in the first half and was denied what appeared to be a blatant penalty with the game still goalless
We'll have a few more great days yet Miguel Herrera the Mexico manager said There is still room for improvement We stayed calm and maintained our focus that was the key to success
Croatia which could have qualified with a victory pulled a goal back through Ivan Perisic but was then reduced to 10 men when Ante Rebic was sent off
Mexico will now face a Dutch side which won all three of its group games and reached the final in South Africa four years ago
Leroy Fer second half header and a late strike from Memphis Depay fired the Netherlands to a third consecutive World Cup win following a hardfought 20 victory against Chile
The Dutch which tops Group B with maximum points had already qualified for the next stage along with its South American opponents
Fer 77th minute effort gave Louis van Gaal side the lead before Depay rounded off a late counter attack to seal the win
Chile first defeat of the tournament condemned Jorge Sampaoli side into second place
Both teams will find out their fate on Monday night with Brazil Mexico and Croatia fighting it out to qualify from Group A
After a forgettable first half it was the Dutch which found its rhythm with the impressive Arjen Robben causing Chile all sorts of problems
But it was the introduction of substitutes Fer and Depay which made the difference
Fer had only been on the pitch for two minutes when he sent a thumping header past Claudio Bravo in the Chile goal after meeting Darryl Janmaat fine free kick
And Depay who became his country youngest ever goalscorer at a World Cup during last week 32 win over Australia netted his second after great work by Robben
It was a very good game to watch Robben said in a television interview following the game
There was a lot of passion on the pitch we defended really well I am proud of the way the team defended
I think we did a great job and this is not where we want to stop It is a fantastic result and a fantastic performance and we don't want it to end here
We need to change our mindset as we want to move forward
The Dutch which lost out to Spain in the final four years ago will play its second round game in Fortaleza on Sunday June 29
Chile which reached the last 16 in 1998 and 2010 will play its next game on Saturday 28th June in Belo Horizonte
I think that this was a match that we expected with the Netherlands trying to use lots of people on the counter attack Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli told reporters
We looked for victory we wanted to win and we couldn't find a solution to a team that only defended and only aspired to longrange shots not even counterattacks
This is a Chile that I am proud to be at the helm of in spite of the fact that we didn't get a result The courage of the group they have their heads held high and they are getting ready for the round of 16
In the group other game David Villa brought down the curtain on his international career by firing Spain to its first victory of the World Cup
The reigning champion which was knocked out of the tournament after losing its opening two games against Netherlands and Chile defeated Australia in Curitiba
Villa making his 97th appearance for his country scored his 59th goal just before halftime to ensure Spain avoided a humiliating whitewash
The 32yearold was in tears after being taken off after 57 minutes of the contest and watched on from the bench as Fernando Torres added a second
Juan Mata fired home a third with eight minutes remaining to seal the win
Australia which lost all three games in the tournament finishes bottom of the group three points behind Spain
