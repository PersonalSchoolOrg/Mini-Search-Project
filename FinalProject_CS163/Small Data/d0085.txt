The smartphone sector has set the pace in systemic innovation changing not just the product but the way business is done  Apple  is taking the model a step further with Health Kit and Home Kit
I already touched on the data management implications  will Apple turn the tables on Google with a well curated responsibly managed user centric data model as it deepens its services in health and home Looks that way
But Health Kit and Home Kit could also be important extensions of what we understand by a business platform
Let  be frank though We don’t understand a huge amount about business platforms even though they are becoming more ubiquitous
Academic work in this area latterly has focused on two sided markets AirbBnB and Uber are two sided platform markets seemore detail on this here That means they have two actors in the market  renter and rentee drivers and passengers
This two sided market idea developed in the early 2000s Parker   Van  Alstyne 2000 2000  2005  and Rochet   Tirole 2003 and was applied to markets where there wasn’t a dominant software and services component  so Rochet and Tirole looked at the credit card market as a two sided platform market
The market dynamic underlying this two sided market echoes the network effect  when actors in a market need counter parties networks will grow very quickly
Skype is a good example The value of Skype grows as your friends and colleagues join You the user are motivated to promote the concept You sell it to your circle That is the network effect
The two sided market is a watered down version of that strong inherent incentive but it is nevertheless effective
In fact the two sided market is not vastly different from any market AirBnB a platform business matches supply and demand in room renting much like Bookingcom does This is the platform as enabler of exchange
These are two models of platform businesses network effect two sided  There are more types of platform business and not all involve exchange or transaction but let  stick with these two because what Apple is proposing is something much more complex
In place of a two sided market Apple is proposing to coordinate a multiparty market that will include hospitals insurers family doctors labs devices monitoring services analytics and users That makes the market more ecosystem like and poses new degrees of complexity on designing the proposition marketing it and coordinating multiple counter parties
On the face of it Apple becomes more like ARM the center of a complex web of business relationships
It  premature to discuss success or failure factors but here are some comparative features
In the table below a range of platforms are characterized for network effect two sided market multi party and exchange the latter representing monetary transaction
The purpose of setting it out is solely to start a debate Do you think Apple just create a new business model or but off more than any company can chew
Notes  GrabCad is a platform for sharing open engineering drawings Quirky is a platform for manufacturing new products Neither has a direct counter party function nor counter party exchange
 Apple is about to change the relationship between brands data and customers That  the secret sauce in its new Health Kit offering according to several observers of data and security
Greg Lloyd over at Traction Software the collaborative work platform puts it like this 
Google Yahoo and others gather correlate analyze and use personal identity metadata including your location search history browsing history to monetarize for their own purposes or to sell to others I believe Apple is trying to build a counter story on security using identity and services encapsulated in devices you own
When you do business with Google as a consumer you strike a deal In return for free search you get ads and for those ads you agree to your data being collected stored and sold on The way Apple sees business up ahead when you use an Apple health service Apple manages data for you on your terms That is a revolution
Greg  note of caution though is well advised because none of us know quite how Apple will implement its new kits In health in particular the ultimate solution will be determined by standards that Apple may help to define It  also a long road  health is a conservative sector
In order to find out more though and picking up on Greg  intimation of identity as the core of the solution I spoke via email with David Waite and Paul Madsen at Ping Identity specialists in identity managementand Farid Fadaie senior director of product at Bit Torrent for an alternative view of security and identity in health
These experts have a particular interest in the use of identity and distributed systems as security mechanisms
The first point to emerge from that discussion is that Apple has entered the health arena as an enabler There  surely a lesson there for every other business contemplating or executing a platform strategy
Whatever Apple does down the line first base is to enable local storage on the iPhone of data collected by other devices  says Waite
Short term it is entirely on the phone They do not even support Health Kit on iPad from what I understand to have it work between my devices
One of the first suppliers to throw their hat in the ring is WebMD which is already busy on an app to interpret sensor data

Madsen also sees Apple adopting an enabling role 
Apple is positioning its Health app as the point of aggregation for all the user  different health data and Health Kit the development platform to enable that integration  But critically indications are that the health data will for the most part be collected by sensors Nike+ Withings Scale Fitbit Flex etc of other wearable manufacturers… offering  ie stay away from the hardware for now and instead provide the services   software glue to tie all the existing hardware into some sort of cohesive whole
One reason for that might be security The iPhone at least the later versions have fingerprint sensor security If health data passes between an iPhone and an iPad how can the devices be sure of the user  identity On a single device especially the iPhone that has fingerprint access identity is solvable on the device
With multiple devices it becomes more difficult and more prone to the complexity of multiple users
They seem to want one device to represent a single persona says Waite  not a bad position for a hardware vendor to take They encapsulate your online identity for services like Twitter and Facebook onto your device but this is primarily so that applications do not do this work themselves
That also means Apple is looking to deepen the service value of the smartphone something Samsung has been trying to do Samsung however has also added more devices the Gear and Gear Fit in particular Apple seems to be rallying the market back towards the iPhone
It means Apple must see the iPhone as a key profit center for years to come
It does also mean though that Apple must now innovate rapidly in services As Health Kit builds momentum Apple will be in need of a new identity solution Madsen says Its attempt in the near future to parlay data between institutions and devices
…absolutely demands an underlying standardized identity layer that would give the necessary security for the health data as it flows and the users the requisite privacy enabling control over that flow
OAuth 20 and OpenID Connect 10 are likely standards for Apple to draw on though Apple has a preference for doing identity its own way
On the developer side of the equation initially Apple will be experimenting with different ways for developers to use data at different levels of permission according to Waite 
The structure of health kit is such that an application asks the user for each kind of information and the user can opt in or out of write and read access For example  I might let this one hypothetical app read my steps taken and heart rate but not my nutritional information
Second base is to migrate some of a user  health data to Apple  Cloud but under the control of the user Fadaie believes a P2P solution would provide greater security for an equal user experience going forward 
Based on the limited amount of information available Apple  view of eHealth is like a Dropbox for health related information Different apps can read/write to this HealthBox and Apple takes care of making the data available on user  different devices If Apple  goal is to be a provider of such a service a P2P solution can certainly help keep this data private without storing it on Apple  cloud even if the data is encrypted This will be as usable but more private for users
Third base is the integration of the medical profession into the data stream
Part of the challenge there though is to integrate different strands of the medical profession in ways that are acceptable or satisfactory to them
According to Waite 
Today the hospital or clinic would have to have a user install an app and approve it access to data The app can then  iphon’ data off the health kit database on the phone and upload it someplace that is accessible by the hospital/clinic
Pharmacies labs hospitals and clinics are going to want to be able to exchange data directly rather than going through apps on the user  phone The user is going to want to feel in control of that sort of communication as well Health Kit today doesn’t provide that But hopefully it will help build momentum toward that future outcome
The precise nature of the Apple solution is as yet an unknown but what is revolutionary is the way it reverses the current data paradigm away from Google  collection view towards one where all data is managed by the enterprise on behalf of us the consumers
There is considerable momentum behind that new view of data Next week in London sees the launch of the Respect Network a new attempt to redefine data around user needs Looks like Apple got there first
What Do Doctors Think Of Apple  HealthKit
Answer by Jae Won Joh MD on Quora
It has tremendous potential
I watched the keynote and initially Healthkit seemed fairly unremarkable just another way for consumer apps like Nike+ and sleep trackers to output their data into pretty charts A cursory look at their website Apple  iOS 8  Health would seem to support the view that Healthkit is targeted at those obsessed with the quantified self movement 
Calories burned Sleep Heart rate This type of fitness oriented data isn’t particularly interesting as it  been done before in a thousand different iterations starting with pen and paper Why should I care
We’re then shown this screen however and from a clinical perspective there are 4 key points of interest particularly since Epic Systems one of the largest EMR vendors in the nation was mentioned in the keynote 
There  also this 
Suddenly I’m interested
Imagine if with just your phone you could travel with all of your former imaging studies eg chest X rays CT scans Your verified vaccination records Your biopsy results Your list of allergies Your lab tests from the last 10 15 20 years All the medications and doses you’ve ever been on for what time period and why Your heart rate and blood pressure measurements from every clinic visit you’ve ever made
What if all of this was kept in the cloud with instant access through your phone
What if with Touch ID you could grant access to this wealth of data to any new physician/system with a single tap of your finger
Take a moment to see how medical records currently go from institution to institution Then come back and think about this This could be revolutionary
The lung cancer patient in New York who wants to move to Michigan to be closer with her extended family now has significantly more peace of mind knowing that her health data can easily move with her She doesn’t have to drudge through the paperwork to release her own medical records from her prior hospital system She doesn’t have to make a separate trip to the radiology department to have them burn her a CD/DVD of all of her imaging She doesn’t have to burden her new oncologist with the task of sifting through hundreds of sheets of results by hand as she can release them into the new EMR with a single tap of a finger She doesn’t have to worry about whether the images on the disc will be compatible with her new radiologist  system as the cloud automatically adjusts the data format to match
The trauma patient who arrives in a lower acuity ER after a motor vehicle accident and is found to have a severe unstable ankle fracture on imaging can now be more easily transferred to a higher level hospital with orthopedic surgery on call The patient has his X rays in the cloud Within minutes of arrival at the new hospital he opens his phone and grants access to the X rays to his surgeon The surgeon downloads them onto his Retina display iPad quickly assessing the nature of the fracture to determine whether or not the patient requires emergent operation Again  no drudging through paperwork No waiting to process a CD/DVD Less hassle More clinical care
I feel that Healthkit might well be the first step in creating something akin to a universal EMR If Apple pulls this off with the right partners they could potentially solve one of the single worst problems in healthcare today  the inability to easily transfer patient records from one care location to another
Apple continues its strategy to go lower market but with a twist this time around
After dropping the price of its entry level MacBook Air to $899  a $100 price cut  last April the Cupertino Calif based company launched today a cheaper 215 inch iMac starting at $1099  $200 less than the prior lowest end model that is still available for sale
A serious step backwards
But to get that lower price Apple dramatically sacrificed both the performance and the storage capacity half of the previous low end iMac of its new low cost desktop computer
An unexpected decision while the new MacOS X Yosemite announcement at the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference WWDC earlier this month was suggesting instead a high end iMac with a Retina display and perhaps even 4K support
The newly added entry level iMac actually contains similar internal hardware usually found in ultra thin notebook computers like Apple  Macbook Air  also starting at $1099  with a low power dual core i5 processor instead of a standard quad core desktop CPU and a low performance Intel  graphics chip  a serious downgrade from the previous Iris Pro Graphics
An architecture decision that makes this cheap iMac at least 40% slower than the slowest of Apple  all in one desktop computer line so far according to the first reported benchmarks
In fact you could buy a certified refurbished 215 inch iMac from the Apple online store now for the same low price of $1099 and get the full desktop performance Go figure
Financially Apple  decision is a brilliant move as it will help drive Mac sales while not sacrificing margins  if not improving them
No wonder Apple didn’t hesitate to call this new iMac the perfect entry level Mac desktop And probably the one you should never buy
Stumbling Apple Ramps Up China App Store
A couple of new headlines are highlighting Apple  Nasdaq  AAPL lackluster performance in China in the first part of this year as the smartphone pioneer falls behind homegrown sensation Xiaomi and takes much needed steps to improve its China App Store In one of the reports media are saying that Apple trailed Xiaomi for the first time in the first quarter of this year Meantime another report is saying that Apple is embarking on a major drive to recruit more China developers to make local apps for its iPhone since a strong selection of good apps is key to maintaining its popularity in the market
Let  start with the first headline that had Xiaomi overtaking Apple in the first quarter with sales of 104 million smartphones for the former versus 9 million for the latter Chinese article The report points out that the first quarter figure for Apple was still relatively strong equaling nearly 40 percent of the 231 million iPhones that the company sold in China for all of 2013 By comparison Xiaomi has been growing much faster since its first smartphones went on sale 2 years ago with its first quarter sales equal to more than half of the 187 million units it sold last year
While Apple  first quarter sales figure certainly wasn’t bad it  worth pointing out that the company launched its latest models late last year and thus should have posted strong sales for the new 5S and 5C in the first 3 months of the year What  more the company finally reached a deal to sell iPhones through dominant carrier China MobileHKEx  941  NYSE  CHL last December and thus should have also seen a spike in new sales from that partnership
Against that backdrop the company  latest performance looks relatively so so and the rise of Xiaomi should certainly be attracting attention in Apple  hometown of Cupertino California Here again it  worth noting that Xiaomi aims for a more mid range user than the premium customers Apple targets But as smartphone quality rapidly rises and Apple  image dims following several media attacks many Chinese who might have spent extra for an iPhone in the past might now be willing to consider a Xiaomi or other mid range models from homegrown rivals like Huawei and ZTEHKEx  763  Shenzhen  000063
A lack of compelling offerings from its China App Store may also be cause for concern from Apple whose iOS operating system OS is a distant second in the market toGoogle  Nasdaq  GOOG popular free Android OS According to a new report Apple has begun to sharply boost its developer relations staff in China over the last year in recognition that it needs to do more to support new app development for Chinese iPhone users English article
The China build up dates back to 2011 when Apple first opened a Beijing office to support its China App Store As part of its effort Apple has also developed Chinese language software to assist local developers and half of the iPhone  500000 China based app developers joined Apple  program last year Still even after that drive the company only has a relatively modest 150000 apps in its China store a tiny fraction of the 1 million apps available to US users
While Apple is certainly trying to play catch up this scramble looks quite typical for a company that consistently tries to use its global strategy without much modification for the Chinese market That may be a mistake for China whose sheer size probably justifies a much bigger local investment to develop products and services more suited to local tastes Obviously it  far too early to write Apple  obituary in China but I would advise the company to sharply step up its locally based initiatives in the next 2 years or risk being overtaken by Xiaomi and other Asia based players
Bottom line  Apple  lackluster performance in China reflects its weak record for customized efforts in the market which could cause it to lose position to more aggressive homegrown players
In the Darwinian battle for mobile device supremacy is it possible that the winner will be an ungainly hybrid that no one took especially seriously when it arrived on the scene just three years ago The phablet — half phone half tablet — is threatening to do just that outgrowing everything else at the moment If it keeps up as many forecasters believe it will the phablet will become the one device to rule them all crushing the smartphone tablet and much of the PC market along the way
It  against that backdrop that Apple whose iPhone iPad and Macintosh computer lines represent nearly all of the company  profits is expected to bring a phablet of its own to market this fall The iPhone has historically come in just one or two small sizes A phablet will will mean a change to a three phone lineup where two of the models are much larger than before How did this come to pass
The phablet itself didn’t get off to the most auspicious of starts  In the summer of 2011 Samsung showed off a smartphone with a then unprecedented 53 inch screen The Galaxy Note was called big Very big by PC World It feel[s] awkward to hold single handedly It also looks strikingly odd when held up to your ear on a phone call If like us you have average sized hands then you’re more than likely going to find the Galaxy Note too big to use as your primary smartphone Samsung sold 1 million of them in the first two months which left many convinced the phablet was a fad let
But by August of 2012 sales had reached 10 million and it was apparent the company had a hit on its hands Everyone followed suit with larger smartphones LG HTC Motorola Everyone that is except Apple whose iPhone was still sitting at 35 inches until the fall of 2012 when it boosted the screen size to all of 4 inches That allowed the company to claim the iPhone could still be operated with one hand — a claim that  mostly true though reaching from corner to corner is tricky for many — but left the iPhone with an increasingly puny screen in a world that was increasingly demanding more real estate
Change is going to come
Apple showed it wasn’t entirely resistant to change later that year though when it launched the iPad Mini a 785 inch tablet Steve Jobs had famously mocked 7 inch tablets yet here was his successor Tim Cook bringing one to market that Jobs was surely aware of before his passing But in the next year it did nothing more about the iPhone  screen size as Android competitors continued to focus on larger screens for their flagship phones
The competitive dynamic had limited effect on Apple in one important respect  iPhone sales continued to grow from 125 million in fiscal 2012 to 150 million in 2013 Apple was losing ground against the overall smartphone industry but its share of overall phone sales continued to rise Perhaps things were fine after all With 94 million iPhones in the first half of Apple  fiscal 2014 it might be easy to believe that  still the case
But other numbers are more troublesome Business Insider recently forecast that by 2017 phablets would outsell smartphones They see the larger devices growing 27% annually for the next 5 years versus just 15% for smaller smartphones The report defines the cutoff at 5 inches diagonally Further BI sees tablets growing much more slowly from just under 300 million this year to about 400 million near the end of the decade On a percentage basis that might be solid but in terms of units it  small against a forecast of 15 billlion phablets annually
Apple hasn’t been especially concerned with absolute market share figures but it has been the dominant player in the premium segments of both the phone and tablet markets In fact thanks to its industry leading $600+ average selling prices the company makes a disproportionate share of industry revenues and upwards of 2/3 of profits If users want devices that Apple doesn’t sell however it could face problems down the road maintaining that position
Enter the bigger iPhones
For at least the past 2 years Apple has been losing some number of customers who wanted a bigger screen to Android Whether their goal was better browsing typing video watching or game playing the case for the bigger screen has been compelling for a long while But the lost sales potential has been something of an ever increasing gap small at first and only recently something that likely has Apple execs especially concerned
Part of that concern doubtless stems from the growth trends in phablets A report from Juniper Research which used a 56 inch cutoff found that 20 million were sold last year a small fraction of the 5 inch and up segment overall Part stems from the impact phablets are having on iPad whose sales flattened in the most recent quarter
The fix turns out to be both complex and simple Historically the iPhone wasn’t very flexible when it came to multiple screen resolutions The result was that apps optimized for the iPhone 4 ended up with small black bars at the top and bottom of the screen on the iPhone 5 until new versions were released Changes in iOS 7 and the forthcoming iOS 8 make it easier for developers to support multiple screen sizes though and seem to presage the forthcoming iPhone 6
The easy part is sourcing new screens Countless leaks from Asia have Apple releasing the main model of the phone with a 47 inch screen and a phablet with a 55 inch one That would still put Apple at the small end of the curve on the screen size oddly enough Samsung  Galaxy S5 now uses a 51 inch screen and the latest Galaxy Note will sport a 57 inch display But the jump is significant for Apple It will close the gap sufficiently such that members of the iPhone is too small chorus will get a lot less noisy Yes I promise
Bruised Apple
TechSmartt got their hands on some iPhone 6 mockups based on some of the leaked parts It  important to note that no one can be sure these parts are genuine but multiple sources are relying on them to make cases and accessories In a video posted on YouTube the 55 inch iPhone was called absolutely crazy because of its large size The challenge is a historic design decision Apple made which keeps equal space above and below the screen Because the large home button requires significant real estate for the bottom bezel the corresponding top bezel leads to an iPhone phablet that  actually taller than competing products from Samsung and LG despite having a smaller display
In addition there are rumors that Apple will ask $100 more for the phablet than for the iPhone That would make the likely entry price $299 here with a contract which might not seem like a big deal In international markets however where the iPhone is often sold without a subsidy the additional cost could prove challenging If Apple  first phablet is slightly off the mark it might sell a bit less well than it otherwise could
Still in a positive for Apple Keaton Keller of TechSmartt had high praise for the smaller 47 inch model The new design is tapered along the edges breaking from the slab design Apple has had since the iPhone 4 It  also thinner overall That combination more than mitigates the additional width and height for Keller who says the smaller of the iPhone 6 models feels perfect in the hands
Threes a crowd In bringing multiple screen sizes to the iPhone lineup Apple opens the door to all sorts of new market segmentation opportunities In the past the company launched one new model annually and pushed last year  model down in price and in the lineup Last year with the iPhone 5c it replaced the year old iPhone 5 but kept the same fundamentals in place By breaking the size barrier Apple now has a clearer set of delineations between old and new What this means won’t be clear until the iPhone 6 launch in September but the possibilities are intriguing
One idea could be to take the iPhone 5c and make it the emerging markets model possibly without the 4G LTE radio that is still unneeded in much of the world More likely Apple will offer a four model lineup given that neither of the two new models will be inexpensive and there is already precedent for selling something at both $100 and $200 less than the current iPhone which typically retails for $199 If the phablet indeed sells for $299 it could mean both the 5s and 5c survive
If that  the case the 4s goes away taking with it the last 35 inch iPhone screen and the 30 pin connector as well Apple would get a much more unified lineup that it could price more aggressively than ever at the low end Last year many expected the 5c to become the low cost iPhone That didn’t happen which then caused many a pundit to explain how Apple is about premium products and won’t ever head downmarket Of course that same Apple wouldn’t open up iOS to third parties it did or build a larger screen iPhone it will Expect even more change in the coming months
This morning Brian Solomon wrote an article called Apple With Smart Home Rumors Flying Leads Tech Surge in which he cites a Financial Times article that rumors Apple will introduce a new software platform that will turn their iPhone into a remote control for lights security systems and other household appliances Apple shares are up 18% so far today and are bouncing right up near their 52 week high
For investors approaching Apple using options this week we highlight one interesting put contract and one interesting call contract from the July expiration
The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting is at the $615 strike which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1135 Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 19% return against the $615 commitment or a 182% annualized rate of return at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost
Selling a put does not give an investor access to AAPL  upside potential the way owning shares would because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised So unless Apple sees its shares decline 16% and the contract is exercised resulting in a cost basis of $60365 per share before broker commissions subtracting the $1135 from $615 the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 182% annualized rate of return
Interestingly that annualized 182% figure actually exceeds the 21% annualized dividend paid by Apple by 161% based on the current share price of $62544 And yet if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 162% to reach the $615 strike price
Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that in general dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company In the case of Apple looking at the dividend history chart for AAPL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 21% annualized dividend yield
Turning to the other side of the option chain we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the July expiration for shareholders of Apple NASD  AAPL looking to boost their income beyond the stock  21% annualized dividend yield Selling the covered call at the $635 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1180 bid annualizes to an additional 186% rate of return against the current stock price this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost for a total of 207% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away Any upside above $635 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away but AAPL shares would have to advance 16% from current levels for that to occur meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called the shareholder has earned a 35% return from this trading level in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called
The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Apple highlighting in green where the $615 strike is located relative to that history and highlighting the $635 strike in red 
The chart above and the stock  historical volatility can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the July put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Apple considering the last 251 trading day AAPL historical stock prices using closing values as well as today  price of  $62544 to be 24%
In mid afternoon trading on Tuesday the put volume among S P 500 components was 117M contracts with call volume at 228M for a put call ratio of 051 so far for the day Compared to the long term median put call ratio of 65 that represents very high call volume relative to puts  in other words buyers are preferring calls in options trading so far today
