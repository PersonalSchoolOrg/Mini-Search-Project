HATTIESBURG  Miss  With an unusual assist from AfricanAmerican voters and other Democrats who feared his opponent  Senator Thad Cochran on Tuesday beat back a spirited challenge from State Senator Chris McDaniel  triumphing in a Republican runoff and defeating the Tea Party in the state where the movement  hopes were bright 
 We all have a right to be proud of our state tonight   Mr  Cochran said at his victory party in Jackson  Miss   This is your victory  
Mr  McDaniel  speaking in Hattiesburg  was angry  and did not hesitate to say so   There is something a bit strange  there is something a bit unusual about a Republican primary that  decided by liberal Democrats   he said 
He accused Mr  Cochran of abandoning the conservative movement   So much for principles   he said 
Mr  McDaniel  an uncompromising conservative  relied on the muscle of outside groups and the enthusiasm of conservative voters who are weary of Mr  Cochran  oldschool Washington ways 
The senator ran a largely sleepy campaign until the primary on June 3  when he was edged out by Mr  McDaniel but won enough votes to keep Mr  McDaniel from winning outright  But Mr  Cochran used the past three weeks to turn out Democratic voters especially AfricanAmericans to make up that deficit  Early Wednesday  with all but one precinct reporting  Mr Cochran  lead over Mr  McDaniel was a little more than 6 000 votes 
A surge of voters showed up on Tuesday in AfricanAmerican precincts and in Mr  Cochran  other strongholds to make the difference and surprise Mr  McDaniel  who just Monday night declared his campaign had gone from impossible to improbable to unstoppable 
Mr  Cochran  victory was powered in part by AfricanAmericans in areas of north Jackson whose turnout shattered that seen in those precincts in the primary  Turnout jumped fivefold at New Hope Baptist Church  and sevenfold at Green Elementary School  where only 14 voters came out on June 3 but about 100 showed up on Tuesday 
Their high numbers came despite pledges by conservative political action committees to monitor turnout in Democratic areas targeted by Mr  Cochran  campaign  Both the N A A C P  which sent its own poll watchers and the United States Justice Department expressed concerns about the possible intimidation of black Democrats  but no irregularities were reported to Mississippi election officials 
It was an extraordinary end to a wild campaign  with a Republican standing up for the rights of black Democrats  and with Tea Party groups from the North  especially the Senate Conservatives Fund  crying foul 
For months  the contest between Mr  Cochran and Mr  McDaniel was viewed as this year  main event in the sixyear clash between conservative activists and Republican incumbents  Money and celebrities poured into Mississippi from all over the country  with the establishment determined to make the state a Tea Party Waterloo  For their part  conservative groups were hoping for one major victory for the season  Continue reading the main story But after the surprise primary defeat this month of Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia  the House majority leader  the Mississippi contest took on greater significance  Outside conservative groups hoped to emerge with a second victory that would propel challenges in Tennessee  where Senator Lamar Alexander was widely expected to win  and perhaps in Kansas  where Senator Pat Roberts appeared to have recovered from an early stumble overwhether he lived in Kansas or the Washington area 
Instead  establishment Republicans and a surprisingly high number of Democrats helped deliver a comefrombehind victory for a senator known for his softspoken patrician air and his ability to bring home millions in dollars of federal spending 
Mr  Cochran shifted his campaign message from polishing his conservative credentials to extolling his record of keeping Mississippi flush with federal cash  He also attacked Mr  McDaniel for his vows of austerity  especially in education 
Those attacks seemed to work at least enough to spook Democrats  and even some Republicans  who are accustomed to the protection and seniority of a long line of Mississippi congressmen going back almost 100 years  including Senators John C  Stennis  James Eastland and Trent Lott and Representatives Sonny Montgomery and Jamie L  Whitten 
Jeanie Munn  who lives in Hattiesburg  said Mr  McDaniel  represents a threat to the state   She cited a vote he cast in the State Senate against a new nursing school building at the University of Southern Mississippi 
Roger Smith  a black Democrat who said he was being paid to organize for Mr  Cochran  said   I don’t know too much about McDaniel other than what McDaniel  saying: that he  Tea Party  he  against Obama  he don’t like black people  
 You’re going to get one of the white guys in there   he said   you got to make a choice  
In downtown Hattiesburg  Democratic voters trickled out of the Court Street United Methodist Church  saying they had voted for a Republican for the first time in their lives Mr  Cochran  Heath Kleinke  38  held his 4monthold baby and said he wanted her to get a good education in Mississippi  something he believed would be made more difficult if Mr  McDaniel had made good on his proposal to cut federal funding 
 The fact that he openly criticizes Thad Cochran for talking to Democrats riled me up from the beginning   added Mr  Kleinke  a graphic designer 
Kay Tyler  an AfricanAmerican who works for the Jackson public school system  said Mr  Cochran simply never asked for her vote until now   He should have   Ms  Tyler said 
White Democrats also turned out for the senator  Dorothy McGehee  88  a lifelong Democrat who registered blacks to vote in the civil rights era  found herself putting out Cochran yard signs in Meadville  Miss   and begging her friends to vote 
Kino Sintee  17  and three black friends waved  Thad  signs on a street corner in a black Hattiesburg neighborhood  They said the preacher from Mount Olive Baptist Church asked them to help out   They’re talking about taking everything away from us   he said   People still need stuff  
Michael Davis  44  said it was his  duty  to stop Mr  McDaniel   If anyone wants to tell me I’m stealing the election or something ludicrous like that  it doesn’t work that way   he said 
In Tupelo  Miss   John Armistead  73  a diehard Democrat  and his wife  Sandra  69  a Republican  put aside their differences on Tuesday  and both voted for Mr  Cochran 
 Even though he votes with the Republicans on virtually everything  I’ve never seen Cochran as being so partisan   Mr  Armistead said   As a Democrat  that  important to me  McDaniel is very partisan and will align himself with the rightwing  partisantype people  
Those crossover votes from Democrats left many of Mr  McDaniel  supporters seething 
 Our whole system is corrupt   said a glum Alicia Holloman of George County as the last results trickled into the McDaniel party at the Hattiesburg Convention Center   We deserve to be called the most corrupt state in the nation  
Her husband  Michael  was more circumspect  You should be able to vote the way you want to vote  It  fair   he said   But when you’re on the losing side  it stinks  
Foreignfunded companies have been urged by an official from China  top trade union body to consider using professional mediators to help handle an increasing number of disputes involving Chinese employees 
Labor disputes have emerged as a worrying trend that can affect social stability  said Guo Jun  head of the legal affairs department at the AllChina Federation of Trade Unions 
Last year  courts nationwide handled about 300 000 labor dispute cases  in addition to more than 1 million such cases mediated by trade unions  Guo said 
Arbitration tribunals handled about 666 000 labor disputes  an increase of 23 000 from 2012 
 As China is becoming a market economy  it  natural for companies to reshuffle  merge or even shut down some underperforming businesses  Such decisions inevitably affect workers   Guo said 
 If employers cannot communicate these moves to their workers effectively through professional mediators  workers might resort to strikes or other extreme behavior to defend their rights  
Guo cited an ongoing dispute between retail giant WalMart Stores Inc and a trade union in Changde  Hunan province  as an example 
WalMart shut down more than 10 of its supermarkets in China without facing any significant obstacles until announcing the closure of its Changde outlet in March 
About 70 of 135 former employees from the outlet turned to their trade union to protest  They were disappointed with what they felt was an abrupt decision and a nonnegotiable compensation package from the retailer 
They protested peacefully for days and tried to stop the company from moving equipment and other assets from a warehouse 
 WalMart must have consulted its lawyers about the store closure  but rigid interpretation of China  labor laws can be inaccurate   Guo said 
 The law can only spell out the bottom line  Employers cannot expect to solve labor disputes smoothly  even if their decision seems flawless under the law  Their behavior can still be seen as arrogant and unreasonable  It  important to have a mediator to communicate with workers  
The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security listed labor dispute mediation as a new profession in 2007  Talented professionals trained in such mediation will receive certification of their skills 
Beijing Foreign Enterprise Service Corp  a leading human resources service provider for more than 10 000 companies in China  most of which are foreignfunded  set up an industrial relations mediation committee in 2010 
The first group of 35 trained mediators  comprising human resource managers  legal advisers and members of trade unions  started work on the committee in August 2010  said Liu Zhenxing  the committee  director 
The company has earmarked 200 000 yuan  $32 160  to support the committee  work and ensure its objectivity in solving disputes between employers and workers  he said 
Workers and employers will sign an agreement if mediation is successful  The committee will submit the agreement to a local arbitration tribunal for validation  Liu said  adding that the agreement will only take effect with the tribunal  approval 
The company said that by the end of 2013  the committee had solved about 2 000 industrial relations disputes  with employers paying around 70 million yuan as compensation for  peaceful breakups  with former employees 
 Most cases we handled concerned layoffs due to various reasons  We try to help companies and employees solve their problems before tension escalates by telling them what the law stipulates and by attempting to find a way for both sides to compromise   Liu said

Lu Yaodong  an expert on Japanese studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences  said Beijing  meeting with the SDP would strike a chord in Japan with opponents of Abe  attempts to boost the role of the Japanese military and allow it to be deployed overseas  something currently prohibited by Japan  pacifist Constitution 
 Even though the SDP is not a major opposition political force  it has been a stalwart supporter of pacifism while the Abe administration considers revising Japan  Constitution and the ban on collective selfdefense   said Lu   Such contacts are conducive to ties and regional peace  
The threeday visit  which began on Monday  is one of a number of Japanese political and economic delegations that have visited China in recent months 
In May  Yu held talks with a Japanese delegation led by Takeshi Noda  a veteran lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party

BEIJING  The Chinese government plans to increase the total number of students at vocational education institutions to 38 3 million by 2020  a government guideline said Sunday 
In 2020  there will be about 23 5 million pupils at vocational schools  which in China take in students after they finish the first three years in middle schools  said the guideline to boost vocational education  which was issued by the State Council  China  cabinet 
There will be 14 8 million pupils at vocational colleges that admit students from ordinary high schools and vocational schools and offer two or three years of further vocational education  according to the document 
Currently a total of 29 34 million students study at 13 600 vocational schools and colleges across China 
Although the country has the world  most vocational education institutions  many of them have problems such as poor management  underdeveloped infrastructure  limited investment and shortage of faculty  said Ge Daokai  head of the vocational education division under the Ministry of Education 
A more effective system needs to be established so that more young people can receive good skills training before they enter the employment market  Ge said 
Also  a more skilled labor force is needed as the country restructures economically from laborintensive industries to technologyintensive ones  he added 
Vocational education is considered inferior to ordinary schools and seen as an option for students with worse academic performance  The improvement of education quality at vocational schools is expected to change people  perspective 
According to the guideline  local governments are required to allocate a standard budget for vocational schools and colleges as they do for ordinary schools 
Enterprises and nongovernmental organizations are encouraged to sponsor vocational schools and colleges  Private vocational education institutions will receive allowances through government purchases of services 
Donations from enterprises to vocational schools will not be taxed and private vocational schools will enjoy preferential loans from banks 
Enterprises are also welcomed to work with vocational schools to train their employees and provide internships for students of these schools 
Also  the health department is considering transforming some ordinary colleges to vocational ones that offer education and skills training of more edgy and sophisticated professions  Ge said 
There will be pilot projects at a few colleges initially  he added 
Twentythree suspects  including students and teachers  are being held in the national college entrance exam  ghostwriter  scandal in Henan province  the province  admission office said on Thursday 
The scandal will not affect other examassessment procedures  the office added 
 The admission scores and process will not be affected by the ongoing investigation   said Liu Zhengjun  director of the publicity department at the admissions office in Henan province  The admission scores will be publicized on Thursday  he added 
Investigators say several teachers organized college students to take gaokao exams using the names of real applicants during the exam in Henan  Qixian and Tongxu counties  The teachers bribed exam monitors and other officials to get the imposters through the stringent checks 
Soon after China Central Television exposed the scandal  education and public security bureaus in the province started investigating  including thorough comparisons of photos  videos and fingerprints of all the province  participating students 
Of the 23 suspects being held as of Wednesday night  four are students suspected of using surrogate test takers 
 Once confirmed  those students will have a score of zero for the exam   said Liu from the admissions office  adding that additional checks will be added to the college register process 
As the investigation continues  more  suspects will be identified  said Luo Lie  publicity official from the public security bureau in Kaifeng  where the two counties are located 
Before the CCTV report  Henan province had found a total of 127 students using ghostwriters 
 We took fingerprints by machines before the exam  but the surrogate examtakers can still finish their task  which means the supervision measure is not efficient   said Ma Muyu  18  a participant in the gaokao from Zhengzhou  the capital of Henan 
Mu Aimin  Ma  mother  also said the exam supervision is lax  and that makes the competition unfair 
 The parents who hired ghostwriters did not help their children at all  They are responsible for the future of their children and the surrogate examtakers too   she said 
Though authorities have used technology to fend off ghostwriters  similar incidents have occurred in many provinces in recent years 
 The root cause of such repeated scandals in gaokao lies in the current education management system   said Chu Zhaohui  a senior researcher at National Institute of Education 
Schools and teachers are under instructions of education departments  If people can bribe officials at the top of the system  then they can go through the whole process easily 
 Setting up a professional committee to organize the college entrance exam is an efficient way  to deal with the scandal  he said  Such a committee would be immune from the direct influence of education departments  keeping the exam fair  he added 
As South Korean reality shows  dramas and pop music sweep Chinese television screens  tourism officials and agencies are looking to further tap their commercial potential 
China replaced Japan as the largest source of tourists to South Korea in 2013  with a record high of 4 32 million trips made by Chinese people  accounting for 35 5 percent of the country  inbound tourism market 
Among the most popular destinations of Chinese tourists is a display of theatrical sets used in the television series My Love from the Star at the neonstudded Dongdaemun Design Plaza 
As the TV series became wildly popular in China  a drama center in the plaza featuring the TV series welcomed 1 000 visitors daily  90 percent of which were from China 
Choi Yonghoon  a manager with the Tourism Policy Division  an authority under Seoul  metropolitan government  said he sees much bigger potential in tourism from China 
 It is one of South Korea  closest neighboring countries  It is natural that the two countries boost strong tourism relationships   he said 
As part of an effort to increase the number of tourists from China  Choi said the authority has implemented a program certifying quality tourism products in Seoul to further improve the tourist experience 
 Our primary purpose is to increase the number of returning tourists  If tourists are content with the experience we offer in their first trip  they will come back with their family or friends   he said 
The Seoul authority is also keenly aware of the role Korean pop culture could play in attracting more Chinese tourists  It has already hosted showcase events in China  including in Beijing and Guangzhou  to promote package tours  including those that offer a pop culture experience 
Choi said the authority is also concerned about the large number of lowquality travel packages in the market  most of which force tourists to purchase products at designated shops to make up for discounted prices 
 Such tourism products not only reduce the satisfaction index among the tourists  they also damage the image of the country   he said 
The metropolitan government has so far certified 10 tour packages targeting Chinese tourists and setting strict standards for accommodations  restaurants  cultural experiences and tour guides 
A survey conducted by the Seoul Tourism Organization shows that an overwhelming percentage of Chinese tourists are young women interested in shopping or facelifts 
 We want to attract the young women because they have proven shopping capacity   said Ko Wuisung  chief of the tourism marketing team with the organization 
Ko said the organization will encourage tourist agencies to showcase the city through all five human senses through the certification system 
The purchasing power of Chinese tourists has already impressed Kim Jonghyeok  a senior manager with the Future Business Development Group  The group now operates Klive  a Kpop hologram performance hall in Seoul  which recreates the experience of live performances for visitors using digital technologies 
Kim said the group is already making efforts to introduce more performance artists that are popular in China in a bid to attract Chinese tourists 
 Chinese tourists have always been our primary target audiences  We are also considering expanding our business to China to better connect with them   he said 
According to the Seoul Tourism Organization  the most popular shopping destinations for Chinese tourists are ginseng shops  cosmetics stores and health food outlets  They also take the greatest share in the dutyfree category and in the trendy shopping districts of Dongdaemun and Myeongdong 
Zhang Jia  a travel project manager with the Shanghai Moisson Media Advertising Co  which offers travel guides from different countries  said that of China  neighboring countries  South Korea was the one that makes the most vigorous effort to attract Chinese tourists 
 Their efforts can be felt in the Chinese language bulletins and guideboards  and in the Chinesespeaking shop assistants everywhere 
 They know how big the market can be and how willing to spend the visitors are  And they are eager to take advantage of that   she said 
The central government  expenses on vehicles  receptions  overseas trips and conferences dropped by 22 93 percent in 2013  the result of an aggressive frugality campaign  an audit report released on Tuesday said 
The National Audit Office reviewed the expenses of 38 central government departments and 389 affiliated agencies last year  It found that 154 238 billion yuan  $24 76 billion  was spent on vehicles  receptions and overseas trips  also known as the  three expenses   as well as on conferences 
The latest audit report on the implementation of last year  central budget has been submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People  Congress  China  top legislature  Lawmakers are scheduled to discuss the report during a bimonthly session through Friday this week 
About 14 percent of the audited central authorities have not implemented their budgets  and some of them have violated the frugality regulations  the report said 
Auditors found that 149 traveling delegations from seven central departments and nine affiliated agencies violated the rules by changing their routes and overstays during overseas business trips 
For example  a delegation of the China Geological Survey visited Las Vegas  Nevada  in the US and stayed in the gambling city for three days during a business trip in January last year 
The delegation was supposed to visit the US and Canada to study technology related to shale gas extraction 
After returning to China  members of the delegation tried to hide the fact that they had visited Las Vegas  saying that they were staying in Canada at the time  according to the audit report 
Fourteen central departments and 54 affiliated agencies were found to have overspent by 32 3 million yuan on overseas business trips 
The auditors also found that 14 central departments and 13 affiliated agencies purchased 289 excessive vehicles  and that 123 government vehicles were in violation of government standards 
Six central departments and 63 affiliated agencies have not implemented their budgets on the purchase and use of vehicles  with a total of 10 94 million yuan involved 
Overexpenditures on government vehicles  overseas trips and receptions have violated the  eightpoint  frugality rules  the report said 
In December 2012  the Communist Party of China Central Committee put forward the frugality guidelines  which require government officials to get closer to the people by cleaning up undesirable work styles  including extravagance and hedonism 
The auditors found 314 suspected serious cases of corruption  and more than 1 100 officials have been probed on graft allegations 
Liu Jiayi  auditor general of the national office  said a trend has been identified in which officials in different posts collaborate with each other in corrupt dealings 
About 35 7 percent of the corruption cases were jointly committed by collaborating officials  and 31 cases involved officials' family members  Liu told lawmakers on Tuesday 
Some corrupt officials make illegal gains through a third party  generally NGOs or companies  which makes supervision difficult  he said
